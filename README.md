AI Decentralized Marketplace
Project Overview
The AI Decentralized Marketplace is a blockchain-based web application that allows users to list, purchase, rate, and view AI models. The marketplace operates on the Ethereum network, where each AI model is represented as a smart contract entry. Users can interact with the marketplace using MetaMask or other Ethereum-compatible wallets.

Key Features:
List a New AI Model: Creators can list their AI models for sale on the marketplace.
Purchase Models: Buyers can purchase AI models using Ether (ETH).
Rate Purchased Models: Buyers can rate the models they’ve purchased.
View Model Details: Users can view details of each AI model available in the marketplace.
Withdraw Funds: Model creators can withdraw the funds from their model sales.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v12 or higher)
MetaMask browser extension (or any other Ethereum wallet)
Ethereum Test Network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli) for testing transactions
Smart Contract Requirements:
The smart contract for the AI Decentralized Marketplace must be deployed on the Ethereum network.
Make sure to update the contract address and ABI in app.js to match your deployed contract.
Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/janellefromdreams/solidity2.git
cd solidity2
2. Install Dependencies
npm install
3. Start the Development Server
node server.js
4. Open the Application in Your Browser
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. Make sure MetaMask is installed and connected to the correct Ethereum network.

How to Use
List a New AI Model:

Fill in the form with model details (name, description, and price) and click the "List Model" button.
This will call the listModel function on the smart contract and list the model on the marketplace.
Purchase a Model:

Browse the available models in the marketplace.

View Model Details:

Click the "Details" button next to any model to view its full description and details.
Withdraw Funds (for model creators):

If you are a creator, click the "Withdraw Funds" button to retrieve the ETH you've earned from model sales.
